# Surfs_UP

## Project Background
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Summary 
Based on our Data Analysis, Data Provided, we can state as a high-level summary of results that Standard deviation is 3.25 in June and 3.75 in December, making a 0.5 difference between both seasons.
 
In addition, current data provide attributes such precipitation and others, with two queries that our analysis pursue, performing weather data for June and December that helps results to decide how we would like to build the shop and what areas would make this location attractive to visitors to stop by and have a successful business.
